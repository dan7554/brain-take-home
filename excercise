Hi Daniel,

Your application has been reviewed by our technical staff for Lead Front End Engineer and they would like to see a sample of your coding skills. Please follow the below steps and reply all with your submission:

Create a Tic Tac Toe game, using Front End technologies. This game should feature:

User vs. User functionality
An undo button that removes the last move
Production level code
A Responsive Layout
When complete, please create a public git repo with a readme on how to run the app.
Bonus:
In the fictional country of ‘Frontenddevlandia’, Tic-tac-toe enthusiasts do not use X’s and O’s for this sport, X’s in their culture are actually Vector-based Squares and O’s are known to be any variant of Sean Connery’s face from Zardoz. It’s a weird culture, but we must adapt! This is a must if we want to be included in the Tic Tac Toe World Championships of 2021. We need the ability to hot swap these pieces at any given time throughout the game. Please create the UI and functionality for this.

Please reply back to this email so we know you've received it (and it didn't end up in spam).

We appreciate your response and time.

Best,

Brain Corporation Hiring Team
